        <h3>Hey there!</h3>
        <img class="alignright" src="images/dubrovnik.jpg" alt="Jeremy and June Westenra in Dubrovnik" width="312" height="237" />
        <p><strong>We’re a husband and wife team of professional travel managers based in Auckland, New Zealand.</strong> With over forty years’ combined experience in the travel industry, we’re blooming amazing at identifying the best products, nailing down the best prices, and watching your back when things go pear-shaped.</p>
        <p>We know you could book your own flights online, and you’re most welcome to if that’s what you prefer. But we also know that organising travel arrangements can be stressful and time-consuming, and that airlines will pull the rug out from under you at the slightest opportunity. We provide peace of mind, with thorough briefings and the security of a real person if after-sales help is needed.</p>

        <h3>What we do</h3>
        <p>We specialise in complex itinerary planning for clients using fares that combine the best airfare deals for connections, costs,  frequent flyer points and short travel times. We cater for all parts of travel arrangements including airfares, rail, rental cars, accommodation, insurance and passport/visa requirements. Whilst we operate independently and manage our own client-base, we are associated with Orbit Corporate Travel / House of Travel. This gives us the buying power of one of New Zealand's largest corporate travel agencies, allowing us to pass on the best possible deals and packages to you. In an industry dominated by impersonal online travel bookings, we endeavour to keep our business personal.</p>

        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <img class="alignright" src="images/jeremyAndJune.jpg" alt="Jeremy and June in Queenstown" width="300" height="200" />
        <p>We are June and Jeremy Westenra, a couple of experienced travel managers based in Auckland.</p>
        <p>Jeremy has been helping people plan their dream trips as long as he can remember, having spent 21 years at Air New Zealand, before leaving in 1992 to operate in the business for which he holds a passion, on his own account. For the last 15 years he has run his own corporate travel management business.</p>
        <p>June was formerly a product manager in the food business and became involved in the travel industry fourteen years ago as the business expanded. Her specialty areas include incentive travel, conferences and special interest groups, cruises, and high-end luxury travel.</p>
        <p>In their spare time, we have a passion for skiing, and also enjoy getting away to Taupo for the odd weekend of fishing and golf.</p>

        <h3>What people say about us</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&ldquo;Having a good travel agent is priceless and I have been fortunate enough to have found one in Jeremy Westenra with whom I have been dealing for the last five years.</p>
          <p>Much of my working and private life has been spent travelling and therefore my trips are often date and airline specific.  Due to the nature of my business, bookings are frequently made at the last minute with budget restrictions and Jeremy and June have never failed to provide professional and efficient service.</p>
          <p>When it comes to my personal travel, I am very particular about destinations and accommodation.  Jeremy and June go out of their way to research my requests with an eye for detail and provide a personal service, the standard of which is hard to surpass.&rdquo;</p>
