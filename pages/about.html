<h2>About us</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="../images/jeremyAndJune.jpg" alt="Jeremy and June in Queenstown" width="300" height="200" />
<p>We are June and Jeremy Westenra, a couple of experienced travel managers based in Auckland.</p>
<p>Jeremy has been helping people plan their dream trips as long as he can remember, having spent 21 years at Air New Zealand, before leaving in 1992 to operate in the business for which he holds a passion, on his own account. For the last 15 years he has run his own corporate travel management business.</p>
<p>June was formerly a product manager in the food business and became involved in the travel industry fourteen years ago as the business expanded. Her specialty areas include incentive travel, conferences and special interest groups, cruises, and high-end luxury travel.</p>
<p>In their spare time, we have a passion for skiing, and also enjoy getting away to Taupo for the odd weekend of fishing and golf.</p>

<p><strong>We’re a husband and wife team of professional travel managers based in Auckland, New Zealand.</strong> With over forty years’ combined experience in the travel industry, we’re blooming amazing at identifying the best products, nailing down the best prices, and watching your back when things go pear-shaped.</p>
<p>We know you could book your own flights online, and you’re most welcome to if that’s what you prefer. But we also know that organising travel arrangements can be stressful and time-consuming, and that airlines will pull the rug out from under you at the slightest opportunity. We provide peace of mind, with thorough briefings and the security of a real person if after-sales help is needed.</p>
