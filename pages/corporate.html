<h3>Bespoke business travel planning</h3>
<p>We specialise in complex itinerary planning for clients using fares that combine the best airfare deals for connections, costs,  frequent flyer points and short travel times. We cater for all parts of travel arrangements including airfares, rail, rental cars, accommodation, insurance and passport/visa requirements. Whilst we operate independently and manage our own client-base, we are associated with Orbit Corporate Travel / House of Travel. This gives us the buying power of one of New Zealand's largest corporate travel agencies, allowing us to pass on the best possible deals and packages to you. In an industry dominated by impersonal online travel bookings, we endeavour to keep our business personal.</p>
